Mocks can no longer be provided as the specs for other Mocks. As a result, an already-mocked object cannot be passed to `mock.Mock()`. This can uncover bugs in tests since these Mock-derived Mocks will always pass certain tests (e.g. isinstance) and builtin assert functions (e.g. assert_called_once_with) will unconditionally pass.
