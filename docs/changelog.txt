 CHANGELOG
===========

2010/06/XX Version 0.7.0
------------------------

* Addition of ``mocksignature``
* Ability to mock magic methods
* Ability to use patch and patch_object as class decorators
* Renamed ``patch_object`` to ``patch.object`` (``patch_object`` is deprecated)
* Addition of ``MagicMock`` class with all magic methods pre-created for you
* Python 3 compatibility
* Addition of ``mocksignature`` argument to ``patch`` and ``patch_object``
* ``help(mock)`` works now (on the module). Can no longer use ``__bases__``
  as a valid sentinel name (thanks to Stephen Emslie for reporting and
  diagnosing this)
* Addition of soft comparisons: call_args, call_args_list and method_calls
  return now tuple-like objects which compare equal even when empty args
  or kwargs are skipped
* BUGFIX: ``side_effect`` now works with ``BaseException`` exceptions like
  ``KeyboardInterrupt``
* BUGFIX: patching the same object twice not restores the patches correctly
* The tests now require `unittest2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2>`_
  to run
* `Konrad Delong <http://konryd.blogspot.com/>`_ added as co-maintainer

Not done yet:

* Test mocksignature argument to patch
* Test deleting magic methods
* Interaction of magic methods with spec, wraps
* Should spec cause all methods to be wrapped with mocksignature perhaps?
  (or another keyword argument perhaps?) - defer this to an issue
* Should magic method calls be tracked in method_calls?
* Document the way magic methods are wrapped in __setattr__ so that Python's
  inconsistent lookup of magic methods doesn't matter
* Document that wrapping is bypassed if the magic method is patched with a Mock
* document unsupported magic methods (add obsolete ones like getslice / setslice
  / delslice / cmp / coerce etc?)


2009/08/22 Version 0.6.0
------------------------

* New test layout compatible with test discovery
* Descriptors (static methods / class methods etc) can now be patched and
  restored correctly
* Mocks can raise exceptions when called by setting ``side_effect`` to an
  exception class or instance
* Mocks that wrap objects will not pass on calls to the underlying object if
  an explicit return_value is set


2009/04/17 Version 0.5.0
------------------------

* Made DEFAULT part of the public api.
* Documentation built with Sphinx.
* ``side_effect`` is now called with the same arguments as the mock is called with and
  if returns a non-DEFAULT value that is automatically set as the ``mock.return_value``.
* ``wraps`` keyword argument used for wrapping objects (and passing calls through to the wrapped object).
* ``Mock.reset`` renamed to ``Mock.reset_mock``, as reset is a common API name.
* ``patch`` / ``patch_object`` are now context managers and can be used with ``with``.
* A new 'create' keyword argument to patch and patch_object that allows them to patch
  (and unpatch) attributes that don't exist. (Potentially unsafe to use - it can allow
  you to have tests that pass when they are testing an API that doesn't exist - use at
  your own risk!)
* The methods keyword argument to Mock has been removed and merged with spec. The spec
  argument can now be a list of methods or an object to take the spec from.
* Nested patches may now be applied in a different order (created mocks passed 
  in the opposite order). This is actually a bugfix. 
* patch and patch_object now take a spec keyword argument. If spec is 
  passed in as 'True' then the Mock created will take the object it is replacing
  as its spec object. If the object being replaced is a class, then the return
  value for the mock will also use the class as a spec.
* A Mock created without a spec will not attempt to mock any magic methods / attributes
  (they will raise an ``AttributeError`` instead).


2008/10/12 Version 0.4.0
------------------------

* Default return value is now a new mock rather than None
* return_value added as a keyword argument to the constructor
* New method 'assert_called_with'
* Added 'side_effect' attribute / keyword argument called when mock is called
* patch decorator split into two decorators:

    - ``patch_object`` which takes an object and an attribute name to patch
      (plus optionally a value to patch with which defaults to a mock object)
    - ``patch`` which takes a string specifying a target to patch; in the form
      'package.module.Class.attribute'. (plus optionally a value to 
      patch with which defaults to a mock object)

* Can now patch objects with ``None``
* Change to patch for nose compatibility with error reporting in wrapped functions
* Reset no longer clears children / return value etc - it just resets
  call count and call args. It also calls reset on all children (and
  the return value if it is a mock).
  
Thanks to Konrad Delong, Kevin Dangoor and others for patches and suggestions.


2007/12/03  Version 0.3.1
-------------------------

``patch`` maintains the name of decorated functions for compatibility with nose 
test autodiscovery.

Tests decorated with ``patch`` that use the two argument form (implicit mock 
creation) will receive the mock(s) passed in as extra arguments.

Thanks to Kevin Dangoor for these changes.


2007/11/30  Version 0.3.0
-------------------------

Removed ``patch_module``. ``patch`` can now take a string as the first
argument for patching modules.

The third argument to ``patch`` is optional - a mock will be created by
default if it is not passed in.


2007/11/21  Version 0.2.1
-------------------------

Bug fix, allows reuse of functions decorated with ``patch`` and ``patch_module``.


2007/11/20  Version 0.2.0
-------------------------

Added ``spec`` keyword argument for creating ``Mock`` objects from a
specification object.

Added ``patch`` and ``patch_module`` monkey patching decorators.

Added ``sentinel`` for convenient access to unique objects.

Distribution includes unit tests.


2007/11/19  Version 0.1.0
-------------------------

Initial release.
