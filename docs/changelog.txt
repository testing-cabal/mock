 CHANGELOG
===========

2009/04/17 Version 0.5.0
------------------------

* Made DEFAULT part of the public api.
* Documentation built with Sphinx.
* ``side_effect`` is now called with the same arguments as the mock is called with and
  if returns a non-DEFAULT value that is automatically set as the ``mock.return_value``.
* ``wraps`` keyword argument used for wrapping objects (and passing calls through to the wrapped object).
* ``Mock.reset`` renamed to ``Mock.reset_mock``, as reset is a common API name.
* ``patch`` / ``patch_object`` are now context managers and can be used with ``with``.
* A new 'create' keyword argument to patch and patch_object that allows them to patch
  (and unpatch) attributes that don't exist. (Potentially unsafe to use - it can allow
  you to have tests that pass when they are testing an API that doesn't exist - use at
  your own risk!)
* The methods keyword argument to Mock has been removed and merged with spec. The spec
  argument can now be a list of methods or an object to take the spec from.
* Nested patches may now be applied in a different order (created mocks passed 
  in the opposite order). This is actually a bugfix. 
* patch and patch_object now take a spec keyword argument. If spec is 
  passed in as 'True' then the Mock created will take the object it is replacing
  as its spec object. If the object being replaced is a class, then the return
  value for the mock will also use the class as a spec.
* A Mock created without a spec will not attempt to mock any magic methods / attributes
  (they will raise an ``AttributeError`` instead).


2008/10/12 Version 0.4.0
------------------------

* Default return value is now a new mock rather than None
* return_value added as a keyword argument to the constructor
* New method 'assert_called_with'
* Added 'side_effect' attribute / keyword argument called when mock is called
* patch decorator split into two decorators:

    - ``patch_object`` which takes an object and an attribute name to patch
      (plus optionally a value to patch with which defaults to a mock object)
    - ``patch`` which takes a string specifying a target to patch; in the form
      'package.module.Class.attribute'. (plus optionally a value to 
      patch with which defaults to a mock object)

* Can now patch objects with ``None``
* Change to patch for nose compatibility with error reporting in wrapped functions
* Reset no longer clears children / return value etc - it just resets
  call count and call args. It also calls reset on all children (and
  the return value if it is a mock).
  
Thanks to Konrad Delong, Kevin Dangoor and others for patches and suggestions.


2007/12/03  Version 0.3.1
-------------------------

``patch`` maintains the name of decorated functions for compatibility with nose 
test autodiscovery.

Tests decorated with ``patch`` that use the two argument form (implicit mock 
creation) will receive the mock(s) passed in as extra arguments.

Thanks to Kevin Dangoor for these changes.


2007/11/30  Version 0.3.0
-------------------------

Removed ``patch_module``. ``patch`` can now take a string as the first argument for patching modules.

The third argument to ``patch`` is optional - a mock will be created by default if it is not passed in.


2007/11/21  Version 0.2.1
-------------------------

Bug fix, allows reuse of functions decorated with ``patch`` and ``patch_module``.


2007/11/20  Version 0.2.0
-------------------------

Added ``spec`` keyword argument for creating ``Mock`` objects from a specification object.

Added ``patch`` and ``patch_module`` monkey patching decorators.

Added ``sentinel`` for convenient access to unique objects.

Distribution includes unit tests.


2007/11/19  Version 0.1.0
-------------------------

Initial release.
